# chip-8-emu
Emulator for the Chip-8 VM.

Chip-8 has a very small set of instructions, which makes it very easy to implement. There are many implementations of this emulator across the web.
This one is built using C++. The windowing, input and graphics are provided by the SDL2 library.

There are probably some ninja bugs hidden in the code, which is a mess as of now. Given the time I plan on tidying it up.
